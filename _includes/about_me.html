          I have over 6 years of experience as a software engineer and have worked at both startups
          and large organizations. While I'm a proficient Java and Scala developer, my most recent 
          expertise is in building big data analytics infrastructure (Spark, Kafka, stream processing).
        </p>
        <p>
          I love building things.
          While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most excited 
          about impacting the growth of a new venture from scratch - doing whatever is necessary.
          I'm looking to join an early-stage startup where I can take the lead on architecture and 
          technical development, take on collaborative team leadership responsibilities, and be 
          involved in product development and company strategy. I'm looking to continually learn and 
          leverage learnings to continue the company's and my personal growth.

            infrastructure for a NoSQL discovery tool.
    			<li>
            Recreated NLP chat specific text classifiers and benchmarking tools from academic

            disentanglement in group chats with current classifiers. 
    			</li>
    			<li>
            Created and maintained a dedicated compilation tool and a test automation system for hardware-specific firmware, saving hundreds of developer hours.

            I have over 6 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked
            at both at startups and large organizations. While I'm a proficient Java and Scala
            developer, my expertise is in building big data analytics infrastructure (Spark, Kafka, stream processin).

           I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to experiencing and impacting the growth of a new venture from scratch - doing whatever is necesary.
           I'm looking to join an early stage startup where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, be involved in product development, company strategy and gain more experience with
           architecture and project management. I'm really looking forward to experiencing and  (or almost that).

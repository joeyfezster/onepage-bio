					My personal interests include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Parenting</b>. My first daughter was born in 2018, and she has changed my life. 
						I've embarked on the most important journey of life, and I'm endlessly excited to spend time with her, watch her grow, and become a person that I am genuinely proud of.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Building Data Products</b>. It's an exciting time for machine learning. 
						I'm working through classes at Cornell and online in Data Analytics, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. I enjoy lengthy discussion in these fields.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Hang gliding</b>. I've been flying since I was a teenager, and until a few years ago. 
						While I no longer have the risk tolerance to practice this sport, it's still a source of inspiration, and it defined who I am.
					</li>
				</ul>

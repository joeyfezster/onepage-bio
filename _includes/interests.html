				<h3 style="margin-top:0">Personal Interests</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Parenting</b>. My first daughter was born in 2018, and she has changed my
						life. I've embarked on the most important journey of life, and I'm endlessly
						excited to spend time with her, watch her grow, and become a person that I am
						genuinely proud of.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Building Things</b>. I can't say this enough. I'm highly passionate about creating products that impact
						people's lives. I thoroughly enjoy the journey of the product as it finds it's optimal form, as well as the
						journey of the engineer, as he grows and acquires the skills necessary to build the product.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Building Data Products</b>. It's an exciting time for machine learning.
						I'm working through classes at Cornell and online in Data Analytics,
						Computer Vision, and Deep Learning.
						I enjoy lengthy discussion in these fields and many other (rather nerdly) topics.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Hang gliding</b>. I flew gliders since I was a teenager and until a few years ago.
						While I no longer have the risk tolerance to practice this sport, it's still a source of
						inspiration, and it defined who I am.
					</li>
